 * for which it receives expose events.  This is intended to give the
 * event box a "transparent" background.
 *
 * In order for this to work properly, the widget must have an RGBA
 * colourmap.  The widget should also be set as app-paintable since it
 * doesn't make sense for GTK+ to draw a background if we are drawing it
 * (and because GTK+ might actually replace our transparency with its
 * default background colour).

 * since we want it to draw its own (red) background. Because of this,
 * however, we must ensure that we use g_signal_connect_after so that
 * this handler is called after the red has been drawn. If it was
 * called before then GTK would just blindly paint over our work.
 *
 * Note: if the child window has children, then you need a cairo 1.6
 * feature to make this work correctly.
